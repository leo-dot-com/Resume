                        My friends and I decided to found a sock selling company. I was elected CEO and had to thus manage the team. Even though this opportunity was on a small scale, it still gave me insight into entrepreneurship which lectures couldn't have.

                        The major difficulty during this internship was get acustomed to Bremen. I had never lived in Germany before, and coming back from Hong Kong, everything felt different. However, after 6 weeks I was sad to leave this beautiful city. I learned about logistics,
                        forwarding, custom clearance, and so on; but I also gained adaptation and survival skills!
